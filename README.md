<h1>The purpose of this project is to create a Rock Paper Scissors game in the console.</h1>

It is supposed to ask the user to enter either Rock, Paper or Scissors into a prompt. Then also have the computer randomly pick one and put it up agains the users entered choice. If the user choice wins the console would log that the user won, and if the computer choice wins then the console log would reflect that.
